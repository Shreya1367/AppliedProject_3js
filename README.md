Here’s a sample GitHub README file for your Three.js animation project, tailored for a project built with VS Code:

---

# **Three.js Animation Project**

A 3D animation project created using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and developed in **Visual Studio Code**. This project demonstrates the use of Three.js to create dynamic, interactive 3D animations rendered in a web browser.

---

## **Features**
- Real-time rendering of 3D scenes with animations.
- Custom lighting and shadows.
- User interaction with controls (e.g., orbit controls, mouse events).
- Integration of audio for an immersive experience.
- Modular code structure for easy scalability.
